# DNZH_InfinityHour-PC

A Work in Progress PC port of Duke Nukem Zero Hour using decomp code. Since it modified version of Build Engine, the code is there. It just needs to be ported over SDL and requires some modification under the hood to help streamline moddding more easily. 

## What's planned
- Porting this to SDL since main DNZH code and build engine already there.
- Setup menu like eduke32 and JFduke has for loading up mods and settings.
- Command line prompt style after quake.
- ZeroEditor, a forked Mapster32 for the Infinity Hour engine.
- PC Modding Support and Delta X for compatibility from N64 modding side.
- Online Multiplayer netcode support and for NukemNet.
- Keeping it vanilla as possbile with few small changes.
