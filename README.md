# DNZH PC Port

A Work in Progress PC port of Duke Nukem Zero Hour using decomp code. Since it modified version of Build Engine, the code is there. It just needs to be ported over to some framework and requires some modification under the hood to help streamline moddding more easily. This is a community-driven project, and everyone is welcome to contribute help out anyway they can.

Disclaimer: My programming expertise is limited, and my primary focus is on promoting the project and the modding scene. I am occasionally capable of handling small tasks. There's a possibility the project will be worked on by someone with advanced programming skills. I will see how far this will go being community project. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope most of you understand!

## What's planned
Here a rough idea what is planned so far.
- Porting this to SDL or alternatively libultraship since main DNZH code and build engine already there.
- Setup menu like eduke32 and JFduke has for loading up mods also set up settings.
- Command line prompt style after quake.
- ZeroEditor, a forked Mapster32 for the Infinity Hour engine.
- PC Modding Support and Delta X for compatibility from N64 modding side.
- Online Multiplayer netcode support and for NukemNet.
- Keeping it vanilla as possbile with few small changes.
