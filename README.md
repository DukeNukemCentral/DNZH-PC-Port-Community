# DNZH_InfinityHour-PC

A Work in Progress PC port of Duke Nukem Zero Hour using decomp code. Since it modified version of Build Engine, the code is there. It just needs to be ported over SDL and requires some modification under the hood to help streamline moddding more easily. Also forked mapster32 to make ZeroEditor for Infinity Hour engine.
